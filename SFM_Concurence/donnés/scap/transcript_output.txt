at the
wedding how did you know about that we
heard you play all the way from your

feel that bag pipes are appropriate for
our wedding why not because we hate them

for you and then decide whatever you
want and I'm not going to tell you what

angry behavior on your part what
threatening letters refusal to meet
deadlines apparently people now call you
mental
yeah we want you to speak to a
psychiatrist oh no you you don't
understand H this is so silly um this is
all just because of a
sandwich a sandwich yeah you see my my
sister makes these amazing turkey
sandwiches her secret is she puts a an
extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the
middle I call it the moist
maker anyway I I put my sandwich in the
fridge over here and oh oh you know what
I I'm sorry I I believe I ate that
you ate my
sandwich it was a simple mistake it
could happen to anyone oh
really did you confuse it with your own
turkey sandwich with a moist
maker no do you perhaps remember seeing
a note on top of it there may have been
a a joke or Limer of some kind that said
it was my sandwich
now now calm down come look in my office
some of it may still be in the
trash
what well it was quite large I I I I had
to throw most of it away you you you you
threw my sandwich
away my
sandwich my
sandwich um it's really important to the
director that everything in this movie
is authentic yeah and so in your love
scene with Sarah she talks about how
she's never seen a naked man who wasn't
Jewish
so so what so uh well the director is
insisting that whoever played that part
be
authentically uh
anatomically not Jewish you get what I'm
saying yes okay no what
an Italian Catholic immigrant at this
time would not be B
mitford so to get this part you can't be
no but you are y but you told them you
weren't that's
right wow wow and it's definitely all
gone there's nothing there to work
with what were you thinking I don't know
I really want this part you know and
they tell you no matter what you get
asked during an audition you say yes
like if if they want you to ride a horse
you tell them you can and you just
figure out how to do it later Jo we this
is not like learning to ride a horse
this is like learning to grow a
[Laughter]
turtleneck I know I know I know okay and
apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet
the director I have to take off my
clothes so that they can see what my
body looks like oh my God what are you
going to
do I just have to call my agent and tell
her I can't do the
part
unless unless what well this may sound
crazy but there may be something that we
could
fashion like what well I'm not sure yet
but um off the top of my head I'm
thinking double-sided tape and some sort
of lunch and
meat all right turkey that won't work
cheese that won't work olive loaf I hope
that won't
work are you making him a
sandwich no it's um more like a wrap
so why don't you go into your room and
try these on and we'll see we'll get a
better idea of what's going to work
thanks you are such a good friend and
this is so
weird we just need to

after one class I don't think so what
you want to see me self-defend myself go
over there and pretend you're a sexual
predator go on I dare
you of course you could defend yourself
from an attack you know is coming that's
not enough look I studied karate for a
long
time and there's a concept you should
really be familiar with it's what the
Japanese call
unagi isn't that a kind of
sushi no it's a concept yeah it is it is
it's freshwater
eel all right maybe it means that too oh
I would kill for a salmon skin roll
right
now no fine get attacked I don't even
care come on Ross we're sorry please
tell us what it is
unagi is a state of total
awareness okay only by achieving true
unagi can you be prepared for any danger
that may befall
you you mean in case someone's trying to
steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your
kettle of
fish all I'm saying is it's one thing
being prepared for an attack against
like each other whole another story
being prepared for an ATT I don't know
like
surprise all right you knew that was
coming but that doesn't mean you have
unagi oh you know what if we made
reservations we could have unagi in
about a half hour you know what
what the hell was that a lesson in the
importance of
unagi you're a
freak
perhaps now I'm curious at what point
during those girlish screams would you
have begun to kick my
ass all right so we word prepared
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic
measures to make my point but I look I
just want you guys to be
safe
[Music]
